"""Family D2 -- DNA supercoiling at the target, from GapR-seq.

Guo et al. (2018) could not explain why some chromosomal loci resist cutting
regardless of guide sequence, and pointed at "unknown chromosomal factors".
Supercoiling is the leading candidate: R-loop formation needs the duplex to
unwind locally, so torsional state should change how easily Cas9 invades. A
biophysical model of Cas9 (Farasat & Salis 2016) treats supercoiling as a
first-class term, and recent biochemistry shows it alters the *sequence
dependence* of cleavage, not just the rate.

As far as we can find, nobody has tested this against sgRNA efficiency in
E. coli -- which is what makes it the most novel item in the project, and why
it is worth reporting even if the answer is no.

The data
--------
GSE152880 (Guo, Laub et al., eLife 2021) maps positive supercoiling genome
wide by ChIP of GapR, a protein that binds overtwisted DNA. Seven wiggle
tracks at single-base resolution on NC_000913.2:

    signal      GapR-3xFLAG, exponential phase          (2 replicates)
    control     untagged GapR -- the no-ChIP background (2 replicates)
    rifampicin  GapR-3xFLAG with transcription stopped  (1)
    truncated   GapR(1-76)-3xFLAG                       (2)

Because transcription is what generates most of the supercoiling landscape,
the rifampicin track is the interesting control: signal minus rifampicin
isolates the transcription-driven component, and the rifampicin track alone
carries whatever torsion survives without RNA polymerase.

What the ablation actually found, and why the names changed
-----------------------------------------------------------
This family gives +0.047 R2 under 100 kb-blocked CV -- and almost none of it
is supercoiling. Dissecting it (see results/INTERPRETATION.md section 1):

  * the raw tracks correlate -0.83 to -0.97 with distance from oriC, because
    ChIP read density tracks DNA copy number along the replication gradient;
  * the UNTAGGED control track, which contains no supercoiling information at
    all, predicts cutting about as well as the GapR ChIP does;
  * feeding the model only raw read density, with no ratios, reproduces 97%
    of the family's gain;
  * feeding it only the ratios -- the part where the copy-number component
    divides out, i.e. the actual supercoiling measurement -- leaves +0.004,
    at the edge of the noise floor.

So the columns are now named for what they are. `eng.sc.abund.*` is
sequencing read density, a measured proxy for local DNA abundance and
whatever else makes a locus over- or under-covered. `eng.sc.torsion.*` is the
normalised, supercoiling-specific residual. Report them separately; do not
call the first one supercoiling.

Columns
-------
eng.sc.abund.<track>.w<width>   mean read density in a window at the cut site
eng.sc.torsion.enrichment.w*    log2(signal / control)
eng.sc.torsion.txn_driven.w*    log2(signal / rifampicin)
eng.sc.torsion.gradient.w*      density downstream minus upstream of the cut
