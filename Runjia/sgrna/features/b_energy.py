"""Family B -- the R-loop free-energy decomposition (CRISPRoff / CRISPRspec).

Cas9 has to pay to unwind the target duplex and to unfold its own guide, and
is repaid by RNA:DNA hybridisation. Alkan et al. (2018, 2022) split that
budget into terms that a sequence-composition feature cannot express:

    dG_H   RNA:DNA hybridisation, position-weighted
    dG_O   DNA:DNA opening penalty
    dG_U   guide self-folding penalty
    dG_B   the net binding energy, with the PAM correction applied

The relationship to activity is *not* monotonic. Alkan et al. (2022) found
efficient guides cluster in a window of roughly -64.5 to -47.1 kcal/mol and
fall off on both sides, so this module also emits the signed and absolute
distance from the middle of that window. A gradient-boosted tree can discover
a threshold on its own but not a two-sided optimum from one split, so handing
it the distance explicitly is worth a column.

Implementation
--------------
Rather than reimplement the energy model, this imports the authors' own
pipeline (`external_data/crisproff/CRISPRspec_CRISPRoff_pipeline.py`) and
calls their functions with their published parameter pickle. The only change
is that `get_rnafold_eng` is redirected from a per-sequence `RNAfold`
subprocess to the ViennaRNA Python API, which is the same calculation several
thousand times faster.
