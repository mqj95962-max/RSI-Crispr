"""Per-family permutation floors, paired fold by fold.

A permutation control re-runs a family with its rows shuffled: same columns,
same count, no relationship to the label. Whatever it scores is that family's
noise floor, and a gain inside the floor is not a gain.

Until 2026-10-03 only four families had one, and the project quoted a single
floor measured on `a_flank` as if it applied to all of them. It does not: the
floor depends on how many columns a family contributes and how easily they
survive selection, so a 348-column family and a 13-column family have
different floors.

This module also fixes how the delta was computed. `ablation_*.csv` stores the
mean over whatever folds each experiment happens to have, so a family run on
three seeds was being differenced against a baseline run on five -- mixing a
real effect with the seed-to-seed spread. Here every delta is **paired on
(seed, fold)**, so the two arms always see identical data.
